# Image Classification with MNIST Dataset
1. Plot Loss and Accuracy
The code provided plots the loss and accuracy for both training and validation data using the history object.
To run the code, simply execute the provided script.
2. Plot and Inference on Single Image
The code plots one of the images from the test data and performs inference to predict the digit.
To use the code, make sure to have the model trained and load the test data correctly.
3. Experiment with Hidden Layers and Activation Functions
The code allows for experimenting with different numbers of hidden layers and activation functions.
Modify the architecture of the model in the provided script and observe the effects on performance.
4. Run Code Without Scaling Images
This solution runs the image classification code without scaling the images.
Simply remove the scaling step from the preprocessing and execute the script.
